          <h2>How to recognize the attack</h2>
        </header>
        <p>To recognize a girlfriend attack is very simple but don't overestimate it, could be so powerful to put you in overthinking mode and, consequently, lose your mind :( </p>
          <p>Let me give you some good <code><span id="bold">advice</span></code>. Be aware of the words she tells you, my friend, she is going to use you as a shield to vent all of her thoughts on yourself.<code><span class="bold"> BE CAREFUL!!</span></code> Those are venoumus! So mind the words like:
          <ul>
            <li> "I need cuddle"</li> 
            <li>"I have headache"
            <li>"give me something nice".</li>
          </ul></p>

        <header>
          <h2>How to react to the attack</h2>
        </header>
        <p>To react and send back those thoughts is not a simple thing that everyone can do, it needs experience and, especially the right timing.</p>
         <p>One of the most efficient tecnique to precede the torture is start to think about before she comes home after long days or just a vacation. </p>
          <p>After a "baby can you go buy something", which in "something" not even a scientists can imagine what can be, the best thing you can do is giving her some pleausable excuses to posticipate te request hoping she will change humore after few moments..<code><span id="bold"> Oh yeah, she will my guy!</span></code></p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="First_moves">
        <header>
          <h2>First moves</h2>
        </header> 
        <p>The first moves are simple as i already explained some:
          <ul> 
            <li>the excuse is  fine but sometimes it gets her mad. I told she will change humor.</li></p>
            <li><p>So at this point, you can try to taking some time and start to cuddle her or saying some nice compliments (girls love compliments, but don't be creepy lol) and your will see how she will change her humor rapidly and, 90% of chances she will forget lol. </p></li>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Self_defense">
        <header>
          <h2>Self defense</h2>
        </header>
        <p>Be aware when she is mad! in that case there isn't that much to do, to be honest :(. You can try to make her mad, man, don't you believe me? Give it a go. What? Can't you go out of that situation? Well...<code><span id="bold">I TOLD YOU!</span></code></p>
          <p>Keep asking what's wrong, do it.. you won't go out that easy, I'm sorry man!</p>
          <p>But see, here what you can do (no, you don't need to go in Tibet, I already thought about this one). </p>
          <p>First of all, keep calm :) and therefore, when she says "I'm good" just reply "ok, we're good so" she will easily fall to your feet explaining what is going on that stup.. beautiful mind ahah. Give her what she needs but don't be a creepy stalker with saliva pending from your mouth and enjoy her!</p>
          <p>Remeber one thing man, this will make your relationship better and will calm the beast for a while :)</p>
          <p>Enjoy your time with her, make her happy, smile and most important of anything else..<span id="bold"><code> Love her.</code></span></p>
